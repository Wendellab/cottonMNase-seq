# Preliminary results

## Heatmap and plot of meta-profiles of nucleosome occupancy scores around TSS

Take one biological replication of D-genome sample (D1) for example, nucleosome occupancy scores of Light (D1L) and heavy (D1H) digestion and their differences (D1D) were examined at 3kb surrounding 37223 TSSs annotated in refernce D genome. MNase-seq fragments were partitioned into two size ranges, 0-130bp and 130-260bp.
